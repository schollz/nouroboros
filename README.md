# ouroboros

this script celebrates duality. there are two channels, left and right, that take audio. each channel can be recorded and each recording's end is crossfaded back into its beginning. ["the all is one"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros#/media/File:Chrysopoea_of_Cleopatra_1.png).

the grid is the interface to this duality modality. it provides a surface that reflects itself across 64 keys that can be used to manipulate tones. the tones are surfaced from chords.
