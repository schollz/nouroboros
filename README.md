# ouroboros

ouroboros is a sequencer/sampler. it is meant for live looping of up to two monophonic sound sources (midi or modular via crow).

there are two channels, left and right, that take audio. each channel can be recorded into one of sixteen loops (eight for left, eight for right).each recording end is crossfaded back into its beginning. ["the all is one"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros#/media/File:Chrysopoea_of_Cleopatra_1.png).

the grid is the interface to this duality. it provides a surface that reflects itself across 64 keys that can be used to manipulate tones. the tones are surfaced from chords.
